Discovery Environment login and setup
--------------------------------------

**Description:**

In this section, we will setup a CyVerse account and create folders in the Data
Store to organize our project.

----


*CyVerse Account Setup*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. 	#### Comment: Step title should be descriptive (i.e. Cleaning Read data) ###


1. Obtain a CyVerse account at |CyVerse User Portal|. Register with an institutional email address (e.g., .edu or .org) if possible. If you previously have had a CyVerse account, you can also recover or reset your password on this site. After signup, you will need to verify your email address in order to activate your account.


*Discovery Environment Login and Data Sharing Setup*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will create a folder in the Discovery Environment (DE) and begin organizing a space for our experimental data and analysis results on the Data Store.

1. Log in to the |Discovery Environment|.

2. Click on **Data** to browse your collection of files and navigate to your home folder (i.e., top folder labeled with your CyVerse username).

3. Using the **File** menu function, create a new folder for this project (e.g., **rna-seq-tutorial**).

  .. note::

     You should avoid using spaces or special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&) in any folder or file names.

4. Once you have created this folder, you may want to share it with collaborators. To do so, select (checkbox) the **rna-seq-tutorial** folder in your data window. Then, go to the **Share** menu and choose **Share with collaborators**.

5. (Optional) You can then enter the names of collaborators you wish to share data with. These collaborators must also have a CyVerse account. Once you have found collaborators to share with, you must select the level of access you wish to grant.

   .. tip::

     See more on Data sharing in the |Data Store Guide|.
