Upload Files to the Data Store
--------------------------------

**Description:**

We upload the metadata and accession list from SRA into our project folder on
the Data Store.

----


*Upload Metadata to Data Store*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will upload the metadata and accession files to the Data Store. The metadata file is a CSV file organized as a spreadsheet.

1. In the |Discovery Environment| **Data** view, navigate to **rna-seq-tutorial** folder you previously created; once inside this folder click the **Upload** button, then select **Browse Local**.

2. Browse your local computer to select the accession list downloaded from the SRA (i.e., **SRR_Acc_List.txt**). Upload the file.

    .. note::

      You will get a notification when upload is completed. You may need to refresh your browser to see the uploaded file.

3. To organize this and other uploads, click the **Folder** button to create a folder (suggested name: **metadata**) inside the **rna-seq-tutorial** folder. Select (checkbox) the uploaded file (i.e., **SRR_Acc_List.txt**) and click the **More Actions** button; choose **Move** and then use the **Browse** button to select the created **metadata** folder as your destination to move these files to. Click **Move** to complete this action. You may need to refresh your browser to see changes.
