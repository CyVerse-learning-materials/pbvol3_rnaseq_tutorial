Upload files to the Data Store
--------------------------------

**Description:**

We upload the metadata and accession list from SRA into our project folder on
the data store.

----


*Upload Metadata to Data Store*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will upload the metadata and accession files to the Data Store. The metadata file is a CSV file organized as a spreadsheet.

1. In the |Discovery Environment|, navigate to **rna-seq-tutorial** the folder you created.  Open the folder and then go to the **File** menu, then select **Simple Upload from Desktop**.

2. Browse your local computer to select the two files from the SRA (i.e., **SraRunTable.txt** and **SRR_Acc_List.txt**); click **Upload**.

3. To organize these files once upload is complete, go to the **File** menu, and create a folder (suggested name: **metadata**). You can select and then drag the uploaded files into this newly created folder. It may take a moment to update your browser, **Refresh** if necessary.
